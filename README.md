# Keith's Heading

Project notes here with original README below. Then I'll rewrite this if it works. Initially, I want to: 
- change repository name to include prospra
- understand the author handle setting in Skeleventy template /site/globals/site.json (currently changed from @joe_dyer1 to @keithtaylor)
- add favicon png and svg files referred to in site.json
- configure package.json
- deploy to Cloudflare Pages. 

Then later:
- create useful 404 page
- add PWA capabilities, including push notifications (OneSignal).
Amend this todo list as project progresses. Adding detailed notes below with latest changes first

## 210818 Abandoned
I screwed up by trying to run this through Gitpod using my "tech" repo which was linked here. But while trying to restart, I realized this template is more complicated than I need. So although it looks nice, it has a lot of bloat that I don't want. So I'm going to restart with a simple template. Then I can "borrow" code from templates like this as I add the features that I want.

## 210817 1st Config
Usually, I create a 1st Config branch to get a working site with config changes as per original README instructions and note files changed with any additional notes. Most of this detail is deleted from final README but it serves to keep track of installation progress.
For this Skeleventy template, there are no step-by-step installation instructions. But I've searched for 'url' and found some config info at
- /site/globals/site.json
- menu.json
- site.js

# An Eleventy starter skeleton

Skeleventy gives you a rock solid foundation to build fast and accessible static websites. [View the demo site](http://skeleventy.netlify.app/).

## Features

- A clean, minimal build pipeline with SCSS and [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/5.0/basic-example) for compiling assets
- [Gorko](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/gorko), a smart little Sass-powered utility class generator
- [Purgecss](https://purgecss.com/) to remove unused CSS
- HTML minifier
- Supports ES2017 JavaScript, with Babel compilation
- SEO friendly page meta, including Open Graph and Twitter
- Image lazy loading
- Mobile navigation
- XML Sitemap
- Clean and simple blog, with categories and featured images

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
Node `v10+`

### Installation

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/josephdyer/skeleventy.git`
2. `cd` into the project folder and run `npm install`
3. Start the local development server by running `npm run dev` **Tip:** _Eleventy has live reload baked in!_

## Folder structure

### Eleventy

- `site/` contains all the global data, templates and content
- `utilities/` contains Eleventy helper `filters` and `transforms`
- Each page should have it's own respective folder containing an `index.md` file
- You can then choose the most appropriate layout for each page (or create more if you need to)
- The navigation is powered by the official [Eleventy navigation plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/)

### Assets

- `css/` for compiled CSS
- `js/` for compiled JavaScript
- `images/` contains our site's images, an SVG icon sprite and a folder for meta images (OG, Twitter etc)

## The build pipeline

[Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/5.0/basic-example) gives us a nice API layer on top of Webpack. Skeleventy uses a simplistic set up, but you _can_ take advantage of extending Mix with custom Webpack configurations, code splitting and plugins such as PostCSS, if you so wish.

You'll find the site's uncompiled SCSS and JS within `resources/` where Mix will be watching these directories for any changes. **Tip:** _it's best to always restart the server when creating any new partials or folders_

### SCSS

- `scss/` is structured into opinionated sub folders
- The `_config.scss` file is where you can change the site's colours and the utility classes generated by Gorko
- A typographic scale has already been set up using my personal favourite _Major Third_ scale.
- **Tip:** *for more scales, check out [Type Scale](https://type-scale.com/)*

### Gorko

I decided to remove Tailwind in favour of Gorko, purely for its simplicity and maintainability (especially for newer developers). Not having _too much_ to begin with and adding in what you need, will lead to a simpler, more maintainable codebase. Gorko lets you add a sprinkle of reusable utility classes to help keep your code DRY. _Credit to [Andy Bell](https://piccalil.li/) for making this handy little tool_

### JavaScript

- `utilities/` contains any global utility/helper functions
- `modules/` contains your site's actual JavaScript, all kept neat and tidy within their respective _modular_ subfolders
- You can import these subfolders into `main.js` using `import '@modules/example-module'`
- **Tip:** *you can set up optional import aliases via the `webpack.mix.js` file*

### A note on responsive images

Skeleventy doesn't have responsive images baked in, the main reason being: it's best using [CDN](https://cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/zsykhj88yzvi0i8kugfs). Check out this [tutorial on setting up Eleventy with Cloudinary](https://sia.codes/posts/eleventy-and-cloudinary-images/).
